  <div class="info-all">ACM brings together computing educators, researchers, and professionals to inspire dialogue, share resources, and address the field's challenges. As the world’s largest computing society, ACM strengthens the profession's collective voice through strong leadership, promotion of the highest standards, and recognition of technical excellence. ACM supports the professional growth of its members by providing opportunities for life‐long learning, career development, and   professional networking.Founded at the dawn of the computer age, ACM’s reach extends to every part of the globe, with more than half of its more than 100,000 members residing outside the U.S.  Its growing membership has led to Councils in Europe, India, and China, fostering networking opportunities that strengthen ties within and across countries and technical communities.  Their actions enhance ACM’s ability to raise awareness of computing’s important technical, educational, and social issues around the world.ACM’s broad‐based infrastructure supports more than 860 professional and student chapters worldwide. These "local neighborhoods" offer opportunities for members to gain access to critical research and establish personal networking systems. <br> <br></div>

  <br>
      <div class="info-all">R.M.D. Engineering College has launched a new industry relevant Computer Science program powered by Tata Consultancy Services from the academic year 2020-2021. To address the growing need of engineering talent with skills in Digital Technology, TCS, in partnership with leading academicians across India, has designed a curriculum for 4 years undergraduate program on Computer Science titled Computer Science and Business Systems (CSBS). This curriculum aims to ensure that the students graduating from the program not only know the core topics of Computer Science but also develop an equal appreciation of Humanities, Management Sciences, and Human Values. The students are also exposed to emerging topics such as Analytics, Machine Learning, Cloud Computing, the Internet of Things, etc., to make them industry ready at the end of four years of study. </div>
